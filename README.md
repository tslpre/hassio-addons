hass.io addons by Philipp Schmitt

forked as Zabbix Agent wasn't working with armv7 (and vcgencmd was not available to monitor Pi hardware).

Add to Home Assistant using the repository url: 
https://github.com/pschmitt/hassio-addons

## flicd

React to flic button presses on the Raspberry Pi.

### Installation

The flicd server needs a bluetooth controller. If you are running [Hass.io based on HassOS](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2018/07/11/hassio-images/), you can use the built-in controller. If you are running the older [Hass.io based on ResinOS](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2018/07/11/hassio-images/), you'll need to install the [Bluetooth BCM43xx](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/bluetooth_bcm43xx/) add-on.

```
Available HCI devices found:

Trying hci0

```

After starting the flicd add-on, you might need to restart Home Assistant.
Your flic buttons should be detected automatically if you keep pressing the button.
